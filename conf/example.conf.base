# This is an example configuration file for the LVM2 system.
# It contains the default settings that would be used if there was no
# @DEFAULT_SYS_DIR@/lvm.conf file.
#
# Refer to 'man lvm.conf' for further information including the file layout.
#
# To put this file in a different directory and override @DEFAULT_SYS_DIR@ set
# the environment variable LVM_SYSTEM_DIR before running the tools.
#
# N.B. Take care that each setting only appears once if uncommenting
# example settings in this file.
